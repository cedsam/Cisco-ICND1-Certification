How to use ACL in a IPv4 network? <br />
In this lab exercice, I use standard and extended ACL. <br />
Standard ACL are used to allow users going through NAT/PAT and allow them to have internet. <br />
Extended ACL are used to prevent users pinging router interfaces except their default gateway. <br />
