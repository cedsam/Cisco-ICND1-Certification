How to implement DHCP server on IOS ? <br />
What happen when the client and the server communicate with each other for DHCP purpose? <br />
 <br />
In this lab exercice, I use DHCP Server on the routers and I turn the PC to get an address through DHCP. <br />
It allow me to use wireshack on a PC and see the DORA (discover, offer, request, ack) process. <br />
