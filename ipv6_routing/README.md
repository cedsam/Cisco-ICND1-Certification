## About <br />
How to implement static and dynamic routes ? <br />
Which multicast addresses are used by the routers ? <br />
How works the link local network? <br />
What are the major difference between IPv4 and IPv6? <br />
How to properly use the RFC 4193? <br />
 <br />
In this lab exercice, I use both static and dynamic route (OSPFv3) to allow the internetwork communication. <br />
It allow me to fully study IPv6 concepts while using wireshark. <br />
The network blueprint and private addressing scheme respect the RFC 4193 (while using a generator). <br />
