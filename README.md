# My road to the cisco certification

I buy and Im using real lab, including the following:
3 routers: Cisco 2620XM (128 mo RAM; 32 mo System Flash under IOS Version 12.2(7r))
3 switchs: Cisco C2950 (IOS Version 12.1(22)EA6)
Password and mac addresses are omitted in config files, and the simple "cisco" password is used in packet tracer files.

## Goal of guess the word
I upload every config file and blueprint that I have made.
It can be useful for myself later on.
