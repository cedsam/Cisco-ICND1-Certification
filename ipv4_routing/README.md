## About <br />
How to implement static and dynamic routes ? <br />
What is the content of LSA and LSDB packet? <br />
 <br />
In this lab exercice, I use both static and dynamic route (OSPFv2) to allow the internetwork communication. <br />
I use security option to disallow IT shadow using OSPF to get information and the raspberry pi act as a DHCP server. <br />
The virtual lab allow you to see the content of OSPF packet through simulation mode. <br />
